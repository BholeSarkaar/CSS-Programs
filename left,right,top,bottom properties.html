<p>Felix Padel This book opens doors to understanding many neglected aspects of structural violence in the colonial era, with deep roots in Bengal, and repercussions that continue to colour patterns of violent repression in the state today. It combines riveting stories of the freedom struggle in Midnapore district with a refreshingly clear historical synthesis and analysis of the war years. In particular, a mass of hitherto un published evidence reveals Winston Churchill not just as bigoted on Indian affairs, but blinkered and obsessed to an extraordinary degree, especially on the issue of Bengal, where his intransigent refusal to send urgently requested grain to areas already ravaged by a cyclone and “rice denial” stands revealed as a major cause of the Bengal famine, that probably killed as many as ? ve million people. This estimate is considerably higher than the published estimates in the 
 Famine Commission’s report on the 
 famine, and is based on a neglected text by the Indian Statistical Institute’s founder, Prasanta K Mahalanobis, “Mortality in Bengal in 1943”, written for the Famine Commission, but never publicised or 
 referred to in the commission’s report. Evidence collected in Churchill’s Secret War proves beyond doubt that Britain’s prime minister knew through numerous intelligence reports that the famine was unfolding, yet wilfully obstructed many of? cials’ attempts to acknowledge and mitigate it. Equally shocking perhaps is some of these of? cials’ subsequent collusion in concealing the basic facts, and a scholarly collusion in failing to highlight them till now. The roots of the famine were several, their coming together was foreseen, and it could have been prevented if many con

 India to mainly supplying raw cotton for British manufacturers, but also a grain drain in which Indian agricultural  exports had become vital for Britain’s economy. During the second world war, Britain’s ? nance for the war came to 
 depend heavily on borrowing from I ndia – a rising debt that both Churchill and Lord Cherwell, the adviser he relied on for most of his economic decisions, came to resent as if it was a personal affront, trying to ? nd ways to cancel it off. Frederick Alexander Lindemann, “the Prof” to admirers and “Baron Berlin” to detractors, became Lord Cherwell in 1942, and saw more of Churchill, wielding more in? uence than anyone else on him during the war. It was his insistence on no famine relief that won out, just as it was his insistence on bomber 
 Harris’ ? rebombing of German cities that  became policy. These two policy 
 decisions alone caused millions to die horribly, in India and Germany. Gandhi was already warning of rice shortage in January 1941. Churchill’s 
 order for a scorched earth policy in 
 November 1941, to make sure that areas of Bengal exposed to a Japanese invasion would be empty of provisions for enemy troops and boats for access, was a key trigger for the famine: rice and boat “denial”, in which boats as well as grain stocks were often burned, con? scated or dumped in water, with radios con? scated. Bengal’s elected Chief Minister Abul Kasem Fazlul Huq complained strongly about the effects of this policy and the dangers of famine in August 1942. 
Famine Relief Blocked Bengal was hit by a terrible cyclone 
 
 in October 1942 – just after the Quit 
 India Movement had started the previous month. Cyclone relief was distributed alongside repression that often, ridiculously, involved police following families who collected relief food home, and destroying it! This was the context where rice was extracted from the countryside to feed the army and Calcutta “in a replay of the famine of 1770”. At least 13% of Tamluk subdivision of
