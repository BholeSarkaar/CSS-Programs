<p>district died in 1943 alone. Simultaneously, rape was
 being used as a “weapon of war”, with British police and 
soldiers often behaving as an occupying army. Fazlul Huq
 was forced to resign in March 1943 by governor John 
Herbert, for raising police rape as an issue and for publicly
 admitting there was a famine when of? cial policy denied 
this. Famine relief was blocked by the combined intransigence
 of Cherwell and Churchill, deaf to urgent pleas from the
 viceroy (? rst Linlithgow, then Wavell), as well as from
 Leopold Amery, Secretary of State for India. The story
 of how this happened interweaves Churchill’s personal
 hatred towards Gandhi with scrutiny of every link in
 the command chain that implemented this policy with
 a view to suppressing the rebellion by Congress. An extraordinary
 controversy has raged from the time of the famine until 
now about the extent of rice shortage. All are in agreement
 that this famine is a textbook example of a man-made famine,
 in line with Amartya’s Sen’s main thesis in Poverty and Famine (1983), 
and that the government’s lifting of price controls in February 1943, 
while buying all possible stocks for the army, was the famine’s immediate
 trigger. A “loss of entitlement” to basic food-stocks was i nstituted in Bengal, 
while Britain’s e ntitlement was maintained with a safe margin, and stocks 
were not as dangerously threatened as Cherwell had made out. But the evidence
 collected in Churchill’s Secret War implies that many factors combined
 to cause an actual food shortage, which Amartya Sen denies. A ? erc
e debate ? ared about this after a review of Mukerjee’s book in 
The New York Review of Books from December 2010 to May 2011.
 At issue is the availability of rice. Actually, all parties are in agreement
 that wartime demand far 
 exceeded supply. But how much was 
 actually harvested? How much was 
 destroyed in the virulent Brown Stain plant disease that ravaged Bengal
 during these years? How much was destroyed or con? scated in the “rice denial”
 policy that started in January-February 1942? 
How much was destroyed in the terrible cyclone of 16 October 1942? 
How much was later bought up by the army? And how much was 
actually being stockpiled by merchants, speculating on the 
spectacular price rises? Obviously, these ? gures were not recorded, and in their 
 absence, the ? gures that Sen relies on for rice production are those in the 
 Famine Inquiry Report, calculated from estimates about cropland multiplied by 
 ? gures for yield per acre. Evidence 
 supplied by Mukerjee shows that the Famine Inquiry Commission
 distorted or manufactured statistics, and suppressed a lot of basic
 information about the famine and the chain of command back to
 London that had vetoed famine relief throughout the worst months.
 In his last response, Amartya Sen lays emphasis on the “Adjusted 
Current Supply of Rice” ? gures which the government had relied 
on in the Inquiry Report. The trouble is – adjusted how precisely? 
The government, during the famine, was publicly at least, in a state of denial.
